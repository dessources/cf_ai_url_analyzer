## Prompt 1: Initial Project Setup
**Date:** Initial conversation

```
[Pasted text attachment with project requirements]
```

The initial requirements included building an AI URL Analyzer with:
- Cloudflare dashboard aesthetic
- Dark theme UI with vibrant orange (#f38020) accent
- Clean professional look with AI-powered features
- Card-based layout centered at 800px max-width
- Background #1d1d1d, card background #2a2a2a

---

## Prompt 2: Add Thinking Animations
**Request:**
```
include "thinking" animations where the UI shows what the background ai-model is doing currently. 
there should be a text next to some "ai loading" animation. 

here is the tentative workflow i'm using:
│
│  Step A: Validate URL & extract metadata        │
│       │                                         │
│       ▼                                         │
│  Step B: Call Cloudflare URL Scanner API        │
│       │  (screenshot, technical report)         │
│       ▼                                         │
│  Step C: Gather reputation/threat intel         │
│       │  (Cloudflare Radar)                     │
│       ▼                                         │
│  Step D: Pass all data to Workers AI (Llama)   │
│       │  for final analysis                     │
│       ▼                                         │
│  Step E: Return verdict to user
```

**Implemented:**
- Progressive step visualization showing 5 workflow stages
- Animated spinning icon with contextual icons for each step (Search, Globe, Shield, Brain, Activity)
- Real-time status text updates
- Step progress tracker with completed/current/pending states
- Checkmark icons for completed steps

## Prompt 3: Theme Switching & UI Improvements
**Request:**
```
include light/dark theme switching feature.
Use some nice but appropriate fonts instead of the current Arial/Helvetica 
the result component's text should not be in "mono" font. it should be normal font, 
divided into foldable cards by information type. i.e. security assessment in one card, 
then below it domain information, then content analysis etc. they should all be unfolded 
when the analysis completes but the user should be able to fold them if needed
```

**Implemented:**
- Light/dark theme toggle with sun/moon icon in header
- Theme persistence using localStorage
- Replaced Arial/Helvetica with Geist Sans font
- Collapsible result cards for Security Assessment, Domain Information, and Content Analysis
- Cards start expanded but can be collapsed by user
- Normal font rendering instead of monospace

---

## Prompt 4: Reorder Results Display
**Request:**
```
The "AI Recommendation" component should place before the "target Url" card and all the details 
so that user can see recommendation immediately instead of going through all the technical details first.
```

**Implemented:**
- Moved AI Recommendation to the top of results
- Order now: AI Recommendation → Target URL → Security Assessment → Domain Information → Content Analysis
- Users see the verdict immediately upon analysis completion

---

## Prompt 5: Error States & Sticky Headers
**Request:**
```
add error state for errors that might happen (invalid url, service unavailable, rate limit etc.)
also, when the user scrolls down to see the details, the "AI recomendation" component and Target URL card 
should remain visible while the deails scroll past under them
```

**Implemented:**
- Comprehensive error handling for:
  - Invalid URL format
  - Service unavailable
  - Rate limit exceeded
  - Network connection errors
- Error display with contextual icons (AlertCircle, AlertTriangle, XCircle)
- Clear error messages with actionable details
- Dismissible error state
- Sticky positioning for AI Recommendation and Target URL sections
- Technical details scroll underneath while verdict stays visible

---

## Prompt 6: Create Prompt History
**Request:**
```
add all the prompts that I gave in this chat to a "v0.prompts.md" file so I can see prompt history
```

**Implemented:**
- This file (v0.prompts.md) documenting all prompts and implementations
